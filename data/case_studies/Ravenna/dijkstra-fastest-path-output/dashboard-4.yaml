      ### Notes
      - The speed performance index is the ratio of average travel speed and the maximum permissible road speed.
      A performance index of 0.5, means that the average speed is half of the maximum permissible speed. A road with a performance index below 0.5 is considered to be in a congested state.
      - The congestion index is the ratio of time a road is in an uncongested state. 0.5 means that a road is congested half of the time. A road with 1.0 is always uncongested.

      cf. *A Traffic Congestion Assessment Method for Urban Road Networks Based on Speed Performance Index* by Feifei He, Xuedong Yan*, Yang Liu, Lu Ma.
